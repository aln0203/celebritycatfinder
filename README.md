Project Description
The basic overview of our project is to implement a simple object finding game in a fun and interactive way using various audios and memes.
The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The problem(that doesn't exist) in this project is
Well, let‚Äôs put it this way: in the magical land of invisible cats, 
every click takes you closer to feline glory. We've got everything set‚Äîyour project is smoother than a cat's purr on a sunny windowsill. 
So, if there‚Äôs any ‚Äúproblem‚Äù here, it‚Äôs that there isn't one! 

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]

Imagine you‚Äôre in a whimsical world where invisible cats lurk behind every pixel! We waved our magic wand (okay, it was JavaScript, but still) to handle our clicks with feline finesse.
Each click outside the right spot triggered a sound, added to our wrong-click tally, and every fifth misstep revealed a mysterious red dot showing where our elusive feline hid.
Of course, in the grand climax, the cat was revealed with a triumphant meow and a page redirect to celebrate your success.
That‚Äôs how we cracked the case‚Äîone paw-step at a time! üêæ‚ú®üé∂
